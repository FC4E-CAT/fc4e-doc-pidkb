This document presents an in-depth theoretical analysis of Identifiers and Providers, their roles, and how they interconnect within the KB model.
The KB serves as a centralized repository for Persistent Identifiers (PIDs), ensuring their governance, interoperability, and compliance within research and digital environments.
