# Hierarchy and Evolution of Identifier Schemes

Some Schemes or Standards build on previous frameworks.

## Identifiers with Protocol-Based Resolver Standards

Some Identifiers not only have a Scheme but also require a specific protocol for resolution.

**Example:** The Handle System (which powers DOIs) has a standardized resolver protocol.

Currently, the KB does not model Resolver Standards explicitly, but this could be included in future versions.
