# Identifiers as the Core of the Knowledge Base

Identifiers serve as persistent, unique references to digital or physical objects. The KB revolves around the principle that every piece of information is linked to an Identifier either directly or indirectly. This makes Identifiers the fundamental entity in the system.

## The Role of Identifiers

An Identifier is a structured piece of information used to uniquely and persistently reference an object.

**Examples:** DOI, ORCID, ISBN, ISSN, ARK, Handle, URN.

Identifiers provide a standardized way of referencing digital and physical resources, ensuring long-term accessibility and data interoperability.

## How Identifiers Are Issued and Managed

- **Managers** (e.g., repositories, institutions) issue and manage Identifiers.
- **Providers** act as intermediaries, enabling Identifier registration, resolution, and governance.
- **Authorities** (e.g., GS1, DataCite) ensure Identifier uniqueness and enforce compliance with governance standards.
- **Schemes & Standards** define how Identifiers are structured and maintained.

## Identifier Governance and Compliance

- Identifiers are typically backed by a governing Authority that ensures uniqueness and resolvability.
- Standards & Schemes define frameworks for ensuring Identifier integrity.
- Some Identifiers are protocol-based, requiring specific technical infrastructure for resolution (e.g., Handle System, DOI).

## Special Cases in Identifier Management

- **Identifiers Without a Manager:** Some Identifiers are issued directly by a Provider without a Manager.
- **Generic vs. Specific Identifiers:** Some databases list generic Identifiers (e.g., "DOI" without specifying the Provider), requiring an "Unknown Provider" entry.
- **Identifiers and Their Properties:** Identifiers can have multiple metadata properties, defining attributes, classifications, and additional details.
