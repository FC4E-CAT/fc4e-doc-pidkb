# Providers as the Backbone of Identifier Distribution

While Identifiers form the foundation of the Knowledge Base, Providers enable, distribute, and maintain these Identifiers. They act as the linking mechanism between Identifiers, Managers, and Authorities.


## What is a Provider?

A Provider is an organization or entity that offers Identifier registration and management.

**Examples:** Crossref, DataCite, ORCID, GS1, DOI Foundation, RAID.

Providers ensure Identifiers are accessible, resolvable, and governed under specific Schemes and Standards.

## The Role of Providers in Identifier Management

- **Intermediary Function:** Providers act as bridges between Managers and Authorities.
- **Ensuring Resolvability:** Providers maintain technical infrastructure for Identifier resolution (e.g., DOI resolver).
- **Multi-Provider Agencies (MPAs):** Some Providers operate under MPAs, which oversee multiple Providers under a common governance framework.

## Provider-Manager-Authority Relationships

- **Providers** work with **Managers** to ensure proper Identifier issuance.
- **Providers** are regulated by **Authorities**, ensuring compliance.
- **Providers** may be part of an **MPA**, meaning they follow a collective governance model.
