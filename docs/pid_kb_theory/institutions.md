# Identifiers as the Core of the Knowledge Base

**Managers, Providers, Authorities, and Standards Bodies** are not necessarily equivalent to an organisation or an institution.

ISO as an organisation hosts multiple **Standards Bodies** by our definition.

These institutions sometimes have a RoR and/or a re3Data reference LOD URI (not shown, stored in k_AlternateIdentifier (not shown)
