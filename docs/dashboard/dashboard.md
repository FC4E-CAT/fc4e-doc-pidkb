# Dashboard/Search and Discovery

The Dashboard/ Search and Discovery feature in the Compliance Assessment Toolkit (CAT) assists end users with finding Identifiers that suit their use cases and applications. It uses information from a PID Knowledge Base, maintained and curated by DANS on behalf of the FAIRCORE4EOSC project and EUDAT, and on information about PID Policy compliance obtained from the CAT directly.

You do not have to be logged in to make use of the Dashboard/ Search and Discovery service.

## Dashboard/ Search and Discovery Are Interlinked

The default view is of a Dashboard summarising the scope of composition of the Identifiers in the Knowledge Base. There is also a companion ‘Search’ (and Discovery) page that lists all Identifiers matching the current set of filters.

Selecting any of the many features or characteristics (facets) of Identifiers in the Dashboard will interactively update the other facets. This functionality can be used successively to rapidly drill down to a subset of Identifiers meeting a set of criteria.

The selection actions in the Dashboard are also shared to the Search and Discovery page, and vice versa - hence any selections made in either page. 

The current scope of selected facets are shown in the top left of these pages as ‘Active Filters’.
